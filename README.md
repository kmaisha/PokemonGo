PokemonGO
Background
Word has spread about the great work you’ve been doing creating software to predict monster captures. A certain Professor Oak from Pallet Town is particularly impressed with your work, and is interested in enlisting your aid in an exciting new endeavour. He heard that programs written in Java can run on millions of different devices, so he wants you to develop a portable, text-based Pokedex program that his field agents can use in their varying computer systems that are used in many different regions.
Objective
To be the very best, like no one ever was.
Your Assignment
Armed with your newly gained knowledge of Arrays and Objects, your task is to develop a program which makes use of simple but well-structured Pokemon and Pokedex classes in order for field agents to keep track of the strange new Pokemon they encounter on their journies.
Your Pokedex will have the advanced functionality that Professor Oak’s field agents have come to expect: They will be able to:
•	add new species of Pokemon to their Pokedex
•	list of all the Pokemon that have been stored
•	list an individual Pokemon’s statistics
•	sort their Pokedex
•	The program that you create and submit must contain three files, named exactly as follows: Pokemon.java, Pokedex.java, and Project4.java, which will hold your main() method. Each of the .java files and their associated classes are described below:
The Pokemon Class
Your Pokemon class, which is stored in Pokemon.java, defines what constitutes an object of type Pokemon. The class must have the following members:
•	Fields for the following attributes:
•	species
•	attack
•	defense
•	speed
•	Modifier methods (used in testing, not in menu):
•	public void grow(int boost)
•	This method increases attack based on the given boost
•	public void harden(int boost)
•	This method increases defense based on given boost
•	public void haste(int boost)
•	This method increases speed based on the given boost
•	“Getter”/“Setter” methods for each attribute:
•	public String getSpecies()
•	public void setSpecies(String spc)
•	Names should consist of one-word strings ONLY.
•	public int getAttack()
•	public void setAttack(int atk)
•	public int getDefense()
•	public void setDefense(int def)
•	public int getSpeed()
•	public void setSpeed(int spd)
•	An appropriate constructor:
•	public Pokemon(String species)
•	The constructor must initialize all 4 fields of the Pokemon object with the constructor’s parameters:
•	species = species Passed in
•	attack = (Length of species name * 4) + 2
•	defense = (Length of species name * 2) + 7
•	speed = (Length of species name * 3) +  5
The Pokedex Class
The Pokedex class, which is stored in Pokedex.java, will define what constitutes an object of type Pokedex. The Pokedex class must have the following members:
•	An array of Pokemon objects, which will hold any pokemon that the user adds to it.
•	You may have any additional fields that may aid the rest of the class’s functionality (strongly recommended). It is recommended to keep a variable in the Pokedex that allows you to keep track of the number of Pokemon you have stored so far.
•	The user will have to input the size of the array
•	Member methods (More details on the usage each method are provided later in the project description- You must have the same method definitions as the ones provided below):
•	public String[] listPokemon()
•	This method returns an array of Strings containing the names of every Pokemon stored in the Pokedex. The Pokedex class has a field that is an array of Pokemon objects. This method will look at each Pokemon stored in the Pokedex object’s Pokemon array, access the name of the species, and save it into an Array of Strings. The String[] output should be a list containing the names of all Pokemon species currently saved in the Pokedex, with no empty indexes. For example, if your Pokedex holds 20 Pokemon and you have only stored 10, your String[] returned should have a length of 10, not 20.  If the Pokedex is currently empty, return null. See example runs for details.
•	public boolean addPokemon(String species)
•	This method takes a String parameter called species and stores it in the Pokedex. It does this by adding it to the next free index in the Pokedex’s Pokemon[] array. Return true if the operation was successful, otherwise return false.
•	You should check the Pokedex’s Pokemon[] array to see if it already contains the species of Pokemon which you are trying to add (regardless of case differences). If it does, do NOT add the Pokemon to the Pokedex - instead, print the word “Duplicate” and return false
•	You should also design this method so that it does not add the Pokemon if the Pokedex is already at the maximum size. If the Pokedex object’s Pokemon[] array is already full, it should instead print the word “Max” and return false
•	See the sample run for more details.
•	public int[] checkStats(String species)
•	This method returns an array of 3 integers containing the attack, defense, and speed of the pokemon specified by a  species string argument, in that order.
•	If the given Pokemon is not in the dex, return null. When checking whether the given Pokemon exists, use case-insensitive string comparisons. 
•	See sample run for  more details.
•	public void sortPokemon()
•	This method implements a simple Selection Sort. It will sort the elements in the Pokedex’s Pokemon array alphabetically based on the Pokemon’s species names.
•	See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort for details.
•	Hint: Use the method compareToIgnoreCase()
•	An appropriate constructor:
•	A simple constructor with a single integer parameter that defines the size of its Pokemon array
•	public Pokedex(int size){
//initialize Pokemon[] array
}
The Project4 Class
The Project4 class, stored in Project4.java, will hold the main method of your program. We will provide Project4.java to you. It is your job not to change it. Project4.java works as follows:
•	The main method will prompt the user to input the number of Pokemon they wish their Pokedex to store. Then main() will create a Pokedex object of that size.
•	It will then prompt the user for input:
•	1. List Pokemon
•	2. Add Pokemon
•	3. Check a Pokemon's Stats
•	4. Sort Pokemon
•	5. Exit
•	If the input given is anything other than an integer between 1 and 5, the program will ask for valid input again. See sample run for more details.
•	Depending on user input, the program will run the appropriate method from the Pokedex class.
Listing Pokemon
If the user chooses to List Pokemon, the program will call the listPokemon() method.
Adding Pokemon
If the user chooses to Add Pokemon to their Pokedex, the program will prompt the user for the name of the new species of Pokemon to be added. Then, it will call addPokemon() which will call the constructor to create a new Pokemon object with that name, along with its stats, computed as described above.
Important: The user should NOT be able to add another Pokemon if the Pokedex is already at maximum capacity (the one you specify at the beginning of the program) or if a Pokemon species with the given name (regardless of case differences) is already stored in the Pokedex. This should handled by the Pokedex class’s addPokemon() method as specified above and shown in the sample run.
Checking a Pokemon’s Stats
If the user chooses to Check Pokemon Stats, the program will prompt them for the name of the type of Pokemon they are interested in. Then, the Pokedex object will call its checkStats() method to look for Pokemon with that name stored in the Pokedex. As specified earlier and shown in the sample run, If the method does not find a matching Pokemon, it will state so. Again, see the sample run for specifics.
Sorting Pokemon
If the user chooses to Sort Pokemon, the program will call the Pokedex’s sortPokemon() method. This method will sort the Pokemon in the Pokedex alphabetically by their species name, using a simple Selection Sort (Recommended). The method will also rearrange the Pokemon stored in the Pokedex object’s array.
•	See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort for details on Selection Sort. For more help understanding and implementing this simple sort, YouTube has many great videos explaining it, and you have many TAs that would be happy to help you.
•	You may attempt to implement better, more efficient sorting algorithms if you are familiar with them, though you do this at your own risk.
Other Important Notes:
Please make sure to mimic the output in the Sample Runs, you know the drill by now. Also please be sure to name your files appropriately. In addition, make sure to comment your code. If your program needs to be regraded manually, it would benefit your grade if your TA were to actually be able to understand what you are trying to accomplish.
